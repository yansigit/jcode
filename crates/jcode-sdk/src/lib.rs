//! Rust SDK for the jcode harness.
//!
//! The API crate (`jcode-harness-api`) defines the wire protocol. This crate
//! is what you actually build a client with: connect, drive sessions, stream
//! events, and get told why the connection died in a sentence a user can act
//! on.
//!
//! It is the Rust counterpart of `sdk/typescript`, and deliberately mirrors it
//! capability for capability. Desktop2 is built on this crate rather than on
//! the raw protocol, so the SDK's design is exercised by a real, shipping
//! client every day rather than only by its own examples.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jcode_sdk::{ConnectOptions, JcodeClient, RunOptions};
//!
//! let client = JcodeClient::connect(ConnectOptions::default())?;
//! let session = client.create_session(None)?;
//! let turn = client.run(&session.session_id, "what is 2 + 2?", RunOptions::default())?;
//! println!("{}", turn.text);
//! # Ok::<(), jcode_sdk::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Connect to a remote user's persistent harness through system OpenSSH:
//! ```no_run
//! use jcode_sdk::{JcodeClient, SshConnectOptions};
//! let client = JcodeClient::connect_ssh(SshConnectOptions::new("my-ssh-alias"))?;
//! let sessions = client.list_sessions()?;
//! # Ok::<(), jcode_sdk::Error>(())
//! ```
//! This uses existing SSH config, keys, agent, and known_hosts. Verify new host
//! keys with SSH before connecting. The remote needs a release supporting
//! `jcode api --stdio`, which is never installed or updated by this SDK. A POSIX
//! remote shell is required. Dropping the final client clone kills and reaps its
//! SSH child, not the remote shared daemon. `connect_timeout` bounds startup and
//! hello independently of the ordinary request timeout.
