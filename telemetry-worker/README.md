# jcode Telemetry Worker

Cloudflare Worker that receives anonymous telemetry events from jcode.

The headline number is **Total users**: distinct, non-CI `telemetry_id`s that
ever installed jcode OR did meaningful work in it. Run it with:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=users.sql
```

## Storage architecture

Events are dual-written to two stores with different jobs:

1. **Workers Analytics Engine firehose** (`jcode_telemetry_firehose` dataset):
   every event, written first. Time-series store with no database size cap and
   ~90-day retention (adaptive sampling on reads; `index1` is the
   `telemetry_id`, so per-user sampling stays accurate). This is the primary
   store for high-volume raw analysis (`turn_end`, `session_start`,
   `onboarding_step` volume) and the safety net: telemetry keeps recording
   even when D1 is full. Column mapping lives in `FIREHOSE_SCHEMA` in
   `src/worker.js` and is **append-only** (never reorder or repurpose a
   position). Query it via the [Analytics Engine SQL API](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/analytics-engine/sql-api/):
   ```bash
   # Requires an API token with Account Analytics read. Example: auth failure
   # reasons over the last 7 days (blob9=auth_provider, blob11=auth_failure_reason).
   curl -s "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/accounts/<ACCOUNT_ID>/analytics_engine/sql" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $CF_ANALYTICS_TOKEN" \
     -d "SELECT blob9 AS provider, blob11 AS reason, SUM(_sample_interval) AS n
         FROM jcode_telemetry_firehose
         WHERE blob1 = 'onboarding_step' AND blob8 = 'auth_failed'
           AND timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
         GROUP BY provider, reason ORDER BY n DESC"
   ```
2. **D1** (`jcode-telemetry` database): the durable relational store for
   identity anchors (`install`, `feedback`), auth/lifecycle events, the
   `daily_active_users` rollup, and a retention-pruned raw tail of the
   high-volume events (see `RETENTION_DAYS`). All the dashboard SQL in this
   repo (`users.sql`, `dau.sql`, `geo.sql`, `health.sql`) reads D1.

Separately consented full transcripts do not enter either firehose or the
ordinary `events` table. `POST /v1/transcript` writes the JSON body to the
private `TRANSCRIPTS` R2 bucket and writes metadata to `transcript_uploads`.
Create the bucket before deployment and configure a 30-day lifecycle deletion:

```bash
npx wrangler r2 bucket create jcode-consented-transcripts
npm run migrate:transcript-uploads
```

The bucket must remain private. Deployment alone does not create the lifecycle
rule; configure it in Cloudflare before enabling the program in a release.

### Transcript access and deletion operations

Treat transcript access as a production-data operation. Do not expose the R2
bucket publicly, copy transcript bodies into logs, or query them from ordinary
analytics dashboards. Use an account with narrowly scoped R2 read access and
record the reason and upload ID for every manual read.

To remove one upload, first look up its private object key, delete the R2 object,
then delete the metadata row. Verify both stores no longer contain it:

```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --command \
  "SELECT object_key FROM transcript_uploads WHERE upload_id='<UPLOAD_ID>'"
npx wrangler r2 object delete \
  "jcode-consented-transcripts/<OBJECT_KEY>" --remote
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --command \
  "DELETE FROM transcript_uploads WHERE upload_id='<UPLOAD_ID>'"
```

For deletion by installation telemetry ID, enumerate every `upload_id` and
`object_key` first, delete every R2 object, then delete the matching D1 rows.
Never delete the metadata first because that loses the keys needed to locate
the private objects. The 30-day R2 lifecycle is the backstop, not a substitute
for explicit deletion requests.

### D1 size self-defense

D1 hard-caps databases at 10 GB on Workers Paid (500 MB on Free). The first
5 GB of account-wide paid storage is included. The worker therefore uses a
4.5 GB soft limit, leaving room for other databases and for pruning to catch
up before the 10 GB hard cap. At the old free-plan cap every insert failed and
telemetry silently stopped (June 2026: ~3 days lost). Defenses, in order:

- The worker observes `meta.size_after` on every D1 write. Past the soft
  budget limit (`D1_SOFT_LIMIT_BYTES`) it
  triggers an **emergency prune** (halved retention windows, rate-limited to
  one per 10 minutes per isolate) instead of waiting for the nightly cron.
- If an insert fails with a SQLITE_FULL-class error, the emergency prune runs
  immediately, bounding a June-style outage to minutes instead of days.
- The nightly cron re-checks size after the normal prune and escalates to the
  emergency prune if still over the soft limit.
- If a D1 insert still fails, the request returns `{ok, durable:false,
  firehose:true}` instead of a 500, because the event was captured in the
  firehose.
- `GET /v1/health` reports `db_size_bytes` vs the soft limit for external
  monitoring.

Note: D1 has no `VACUUM`, so the file never shrinks; deletes only free pages
internally for reuse. If bloat itself becomes the problem, rotate to a fresh
database (create new D1 DB, copy live rows, repoint `wrangler.toml`).

## Setup

1. Install wrangler: `npm install`

2. Create D1 database:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 create jcode-telemetry
   ```

3. Update `wrangler.toml` with the database ID from step 2

4. Initialize schema:
   ```bash
   wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --file=schema.sql
   ```

### Migrating an existing database

If your production database was created before the latest telemetry fields were added,
apply all remote migrations:

```bash
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0001_expand_events.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0002_transport_metrics.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0003_usage_expansion.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0004_telemetry_phase123.sql
wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --file=migrations/0005_workflow_turn_telemetry.sql
```

(...and so on through the latest numbered migration; each also has an
`npm run migrate:<name>` alias, see Ops helpers below. The newest is
`migrations/0026_concurrency_tracking.sql` / `npm run migrate:concurrency`.)

Then redeploy the worker:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

5. Deploy:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

6. Set up custom domain (optional): point `telemetry.jcode.dev` to the worker in Cloudflare dashboard

```

## Reliable runtime concurrency

`npm run concurrency` (or `npm run concurrency -- --json`) runs `concurrency.sql`.
It reports **observed runtime Agent session peaks**, not people, active turns,
or the number of users simultaneously online. An installation ID is not a
person. Counts cover instrumented Agent lifetimes sharing a `JCODE_HOME` on one
host, including idle agents. They exclude old clients without the new guard,
other homes and other devices. Root means no parent. Child means a parent exists,
including manual splits/transfers as well as automated agents, not just swarm
workers. Root and child peaks are independent and must not be summed.

### Migration and rollout order

For an existing database already through migration 0025:

```bash
cd telemetry-worker
npm test
# Optional local D1 check, never point this at --remote:
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --local --file=schema.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --local --file=migrations/0026_concurrency_tracking.sql
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --local --command="SELECT * FROM trusted_concurrency_events LIMIT 1"

# Production operations for the release coordinator, not automatic repair:
npm run migrate:concurrency
npx wrangler d1 execute jcode-telemetry --remote --command="PRAGMA table_info(concurrency_details)"
npm run deploy
npm run concurrency
npm run health
curl -s https://telemetry.jcode.sh/v1/health
```

Migration 0026 is additive and repeatable. It creates `concurrency_details`,
`concurrency_event_quality` and `trusted_concurrency_events`. It does **not**
rewrite or backfill `events` or `session_details`. The separate detail table
avoids the nearly-full `events` column budget and stores both validated nullable
columns and parsed raw concurrency JSON, including presence/type distinctions.
Fresh installations get the same objects from `schema.sql`; do not run all old
ALTER migrations on top of the fresh schema. Redeploy after the migration because
existing worker isolates cache other schema columns. The new table's absence is
not cached. Confirm the `FIREHOSE_CONCURRENCY` Analytics Engine binding is enabled
and inspect worker logs for `concurrency detail write failed` after rollout.

**Trusted results initially have zero observations and NULL peaks/coverage until
corrected clients ship. This does not mean nobody multi-sessions.** Deploying
the database and worker cannot fix measurements made by old clients.

### Intake and trust contract

Only `event="session_concurrency"`, `concurrency_tracking_version=2`,
`concurrency_tracking_scope="runtime_agent_sessions"`, available=true events
can be trusted. Each has `phase="start"|"end"`, `agent_role="root"|"child"`,
a logical `session_id`, and a fresh `concurrency_session_id` for that runtime
incarnation. Starts are emitted when a guard is created. Ends are emitted when
it finishes. A crash can leave only a start, which is not an end peak.

Validation requires JSON numeric safe integers, without coercion or clipping:

- `max_concurrent_sessions >= active_sessions_at_start >= 1`.
- `other_active_sessions_at_start = active_sessions_at_start - 1`.
- JSON boolean `multi_sessioned = (max_concurrent_sessions > 1)`.
- Root/child start counts are nonnegative, sum to the total, and include the
  reporting agent's own role.
- Each role peak is at least its start count, at most the total peak, and the
  sum of independent role peaks is at least the total peak.
- On a start event, each peak equals its corresponding start count.
- Runtime `is_ci` is an explicit JSON boolean. CI events are excluded from
  trusted reports, while CI-built release binaries are not automatically CI.

The only numeric ceiling is JavaScript's exactly representable integer limit
(9,007,199,254,740,991). Unsafe integers are quarantined, never capped to a
plausible value. Raw JSON is the **parsed** payload, not original wire bytes.
Missing fields, explicit null and zero remain distinguishable. Invalid metrics
do not reject an otherwise valid parent event. They receive `quality=invalid`
and a reason, with their parsed input retained in `raw_json`. Other statuses
include missing_version, legacy_version, unsupported_version, legacy_scope,
missing_fields and unavailable. Existing lifecycle rows without new details are
legacy_unclassified. Dedicated events whose detail write failed are missing_detail.
SQL rechecks the invariants and labels inconsistent stored data invalid_storage.
“Trusted” means versioned and structurally validated, not authenticated or immune
to malicious reporting. This is an anonymous unauthenticated endpoint.

Old `session_start`/`session_end`/`session_crash` fields remain raw/untrusted even
if an event claims v2. Their historical source was a process-global singleton,
not one measurement per logical Agent. New clients may explicitly report
scope=legacy_process_global, available=false with numeric fields omitted. No
missing count is synthesized as zero in newly received compatibility details.

### Coverage and interpretation

The report uses the last 30 days by **server receipt time**. End peaks may cover
time before that window. It shows all legacy and dedicated quality/CI buckets,
dedicated non-CI event validation coverage, invalid reasons, starts without ends
and ends without starts. Missing/unavailable/legacy events and runtime CI never
enter peak summaries. Coverage is among received events, not the fraction of
all installed clients or real sessions observed.

Session peaks deduplicate end observations by installation + runtime incarnation.
Starts without a trusted end are excluded from peak estimates. A valid end
without a start in the window is included and separately counted. Per-install
peaks are the highest observed trusted end peak per installation, not an exact
continuous concurrency series or synchronized global peak. Session-weighted
and installation-weighted averages have different denominators. Reporting loss,
crashes and uninstrumented clients can bias both. The raw history has **no exact
repair** because it did not record the required identities/lifetimes.

Known severe legacy anomaly from the September 2026 investigation: a 30-day
reported peak reached **85,318**. Release 0.81.4 also had **2,852 of 7,877**
seven-day reports above 100, with a peak of **1,967**, so this was not merely CI.
Those counts are preserved for audit but must not be quoted as reliable
concurrency. Do not “correct” them by choosing an arbitrary cap.

### Storage failure and retention

For dedicated events, `firehose:true` refers only to the dedicated
`jcode_concurrency_firehose` dataset, never the full main firehose which lacks
concurrency metrics. Its append-only schema is blob1..16 = event, event_id,
session_id, telemetry_id, version, os, arch, build_channel, country, raw_json,
quality, quality_reason, scope, phase, role, runtime incarnation. double1..11 =
tracking version, available, runtime is_ci, active_start, other_start, total_peak,
root_start, child_start, root_peak, child_peak, multi. index1 is telemetry_id.
Filter blob11='trusted', blob13='runtime_agent_sessions', double1=2, double2=1,
double3=0 and blob14='end' before aggregating end peaks from double6. Unknown or
invalid numeric copies use 0 because Analytics Engine has no NULL doubles;
the quality filter is mandatory and excludes those copies. JSON in blob10 preserves version,
scope, availability, runtime incarnation, phase, role, counts, booleans and
missing keys. Oversized points are not silently truncated: firehose:false is
reported while D1 can still retain the parsed payload. Analytics Engine is an
approximately 90-day sampled fallback, not part of the D1 report denominator.

Responses add `concurrency_durable` for relevant events. `durable:true` alone
means the parent event succeeded, not that the concurrency detail did. A missing
migration or detail write failure leaves the parent intact and returns
concurrency_durable:false. Retrying the same event can insert a missing detail
without rewriting an existing one. A dedicated event returns HTTP 503 (retryable)
if neither its detail nor complete firehose point succeeds, even when the parent
row was saved. Legacy lifecycle events do not fail over their concurrency detail.
Numeric copies are directly queryable with Analytics Engine SQL. Raw blob10 is
for audit, not a dependency on JSON-extraction support in that API.
Dedicated event rows are retained for 365
days (halved during emergency pruning), and their detail rows cascade on parent
deletion. Lifecycle detail rows follow their existing parent retention.

## Token value dashboard

`npm run token-value` reports the list-price dollar value of the token flow
through jcode, priced per model rather than with one blended rate. Setup:

```bash
npm run migrate:model-prices   # creates model_prices (migration 0023)
npm run sync:model-prices      # fills it from https://models.dev/api.json
npm run token-value:fresh      # refresh prices, then run the dashboard (recommended)
npm run token-value            # dashboard using prices already stored in D1
npm run token-value:daily      # just the per-day series, in date order
```

`npm run token-value:fresh` is the safe default before quoting dollar values: it
refreshes the remote D1 price mappings and then runs the daily / per-model /
summary panels. Use `npm run token-value` only when the prices were refreshed
recently.

`npm run token-value:daily` is the plain time series when all you want is
"dollars per day": one row per day with the tokens, sessions, and distinct
users behind it. There is deliberately no per-user dollar column, because it
tracked tokens-per-user almost exactly (coefficient of variation 0.147 vs
0.142 over a 10-day sample): the blended rate per million tokens barely moves,
so it was the same series twice in different units.

`scripts/sync-model-prices.mjs` reads the model labels actually observed in
telemetry (`events.model_end` on `session_end` rows) and matches each one to a
models.dev price, normalizing the gateway aliases users produce
(`cc/claude-opus-5`, `openai/gpt-5.6-sol`, `claude-opus-4-5-20251101`,
`...-4-8@Anthropic`, `-xhigh` effort suffixes). Re-run it after new models
appear; it is an idempotent upsert. Coverage changes as models and gateway
aliases change. Do not rely on a fixed historical coverage percentage.

To investigate missing prices without modifying production, export the full
unmatched-label list, ranked by volume, with the observed providers:

```bash
node scripts/sync-model-prices.mjs --dry-run --days=90 --report-json=unpriced.json
```

The report counts every model/provider pair, even when the same label occurs
under several providers. Its denominator is **raw reported token counters**,
which may contain overlapping cache counts, not normalized billable tokens or
the percentage of dollar value covered. Empty usage reports unknown coverage.
`--dry-run` performs remote reads and writes the requested local report only.
Without `--dry-run`, the command still updates production prices as usual.

There are two distinct fixes for unmatched labels:

- Refresh prices for genuinely new public models. Verify gateway suffixes and
  canonical model identities before adding mappings. Names such as `qwen3.8`
  can refer to differently priced variants, so fuzzy matching is unsafe.
- Private aliases such as `Coding` or `mux/fast` need authoritative route/model
  metadata. A single alias can represent different models across installations.
  Do not assign a global price from the label alone. To make future accounting
  precise, capture the resolved provider/model and usage per request, including
  cache semantics, service tier and context tier. Session-end model labels
  cannot reconstruct model switches inside old sessions.

Three things to know before quoting the number:

- **Cache accounting is provider-specific.** OpenAI-compatible APIs report
  cached tokens as a *subset* of prompt tokens; Anthropic reports them as a
  disjoint bucket. `model_prices.input_includes_cache_read` drives the
  correction. Skipping it overcharges OpenAI traffic ~10x, and since cache
  reads are ~85% of all tokens, that error dominates the total.
- **It is list price, not spend.** Most traffic runs on subscriptions (Claude
  Max, ChatGPT Pro, Copilot) or free routes, so read it as "list-price
  equivalent value of tokens served".
- **Check `priced_token_pct` / `unpriced_tokens`.** Every panel reports them.
  If coverage drops, re-run the sync before trusting the dollar figure.


## Prompt-user dashboard

`npm run prompt-users` uses the strict product definition requested for user
metrics: one distinct non-CI machine that ran at least one prompt. It reports
rolling prompt DAU and WAU from the union of `turn_end` and prompted lifecycle
rows, including in-flight or unclosed sessions. Since raw `turn_end` rows have
30-day retention, monthly growth and the all-time lower bound use durable
`session_end` / `session_crash` rows with `had_user_prompt > 0` so both monthly
windows have equivalent coverage.

## Reading DAU without fooling yourself

`npm run dau` leads with `headline_users_24h` (= `meaningful_release_24h_noci`):
real users, release channel, CI excluded. Use that number.

Two traps the panel now guards against:

- **Partial day.** The `today` tiers cover a partial UTC day, so every morning
  they look like a cliff. `day_elapsed_pct` plus `release_users_sofar` /
  `..._yday` / `..._7d` compare today against the *same clock window* on prior
  days, and `pace_vs_yday` / `pace_vs_7d` are the ratios (>1.0 = ahead). These
  are same-window comparisons, not extrapolations, because DAU is a distinct
  count and does not scale linearly with elapsed time.
- **Dev-build traffic.** `debug` and `git_checkout` ids are overwhelmingly
  throwaway: a `session_start` and an `onboarding_step`, no `session_end`
  (7-day completion ratio 0.02 for `debug` vs 0.21 for `release`). Their volume
  swings ~5x day to day, which is enough to make a flat week look like
  alternating spikes and cliffs in any raw-id metric. `dev_build_24h` tracks
  them so the swing is visible instead of silently moving the headline.

This is also why the overall `lifecycle_completion_ratio` in `health.sql` is
low: it is a blend across channels, and the dev channels drag it down.

Release's own ratio was ~0.25 for a separate reason: `begin_session` replaced
a live in-process session without ending it, so every superseded session's
`session_start` was orphaned. Those now emit a `session_end` with
`session_stop_reason = 'superseded'`. Expect the release ratio to climb as
clients upgrade, and expect `superseded` to be a large share of ends: it means
one process opened several sessions, not that anything failed.

## Event types

CLI events (sent by jcode itself): `install`, `upgrade`, `auth_success`,
`onboarding_step`, `feedback`, `session_start`, `turn_end`, `session_end`,
`session_crash`.

### Website analytics and quality events (migrations 0016 and 0018)

Sent by the beacon on `https://jcode.sh` (and the
`https://solosystems.pages.dev` preview). The browser mints an anonymous
`visitor_id` UUID in localStorage; the worker uses it as the telemetry id and
fills in `version`/`os`/`arch` defaults, so the beacon payload can stay tiny.
Web-only fields are stored in the `web_details` table (keyed by `event_id`,
like `session_details`/`turn_details`) because `events` is near D1's
100-column cap.

- `web_pageview`: `path`, `referrer`, `visitor_id`, `utm_source`,
  `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`
- `web_cta_click`: `path`, `cta` (e.g. `plus_early_access`,
  `flagship_early_access`, `install`), `visitor_id`, `session_id`, `pageview_id`.
  Install actions also carry a per-click random `conversion_id`, CTA `placement`, and
  `install_method`.
- `web_vital`: `path`, `visitor_id`, standard `metric_name` (`CLS`, `FCP`,
  `INP`, `LCP`, or `TTFB`), finite nonnegative `metric_value`, and `rating`
  (`good`, `needs-improvement`, or `poor`). Values are capped at 10 for CLS
  and 300000 ms for the other metrics. D1 retention is 30 days.
- `web_error`: `path`, `visitor_id`, and coarse `error_kind` (`script`,
  `promise`, or `resource`). Error messages, stacks, filenames, and URLs are
  never stored. D1 retention is 90 days.

### Install conversion funnel (migration 0020)

The website mints an opaque UUID only when an install/download CTA is used and
browser DNT/GPC is not active. For the shell path, the same UUID is carried by
the copied `/install?conversion_id=...` command, injected into the installer,
persisted locally with mode 0600, and attached to the existing post-install
`install` event. The CLI consumes it after a successful send and deletes any
unconsumed token older than 90 days. It is not an account or telemetry ID and
contains no browsing content.

`install_funnel` stages are `command_copy`, `script_request`,
`installer_start`, and `installer_finish`, with `success`/`failure` outcomes.
The existing `install` event receives an `install_details` row with stage
`first_run`. Installer failures retain only a coarse stage label, never command
output, paths, hostnames, or error messages. The scheduled retention job nulls
the cross-system `conversion_id` in both web and install details after 90 days.

Run `npm run conversion` for visitor/session-to-intent rates, copy, script retrieval,
installer success, first-run conversion, stage latency, campaign/path/placement
splits, platform success rates, and coarse platform-specific failures. Direct
binary downloads are measurable through intent only; shell installs can be joined
through first launch. Browser privacy opt-outs and un-attributed/manual installs
are intentionally excluded from the joined funnel. Every conversion-bearing
event is also written to the dedicated
`jcode_install_firehose` Analytics Engine dataset before D1, so the 90-day
funnel is reconstructable during a D1 outage.

### Token subscription plan events (migration 0016)

All require `account_id`; `tier` and `model` are attached where relevant
(`model` is stored in the existing generic `model_start` column).

- `subscription_login`: `account_id`, `tier`
- `subscription_activated`: `account_id`, `tier`
- `subscription_budget_exhausted`: `account_id`, `tier`, `model`
- `subscription_router_error`: `account_id`, `tier`, `model`
- `account_linked`: `telemetry_id` (the standard `id` field) + `account_id`.
  This is the analytics<->account join anchor: it ties an anonymous CLI
  `telemetry_id` to a subscription `account_id`, and is never pruned.

Web + subscription events are firehosed to the separate `jcode_web_firehose`
dataset (`FIREHOSE_WEB_SCHEMA` in `src/worker.js`, also append-only): the
main `FIREHOSE_SCHEMA` is at Analytics Engine's 20-blob/20-double capacity.
For web events `index1` is the `visitor_id`.
The 0018 fields were appended without reordering: `blob18=metric_name`,
`blob19=rating`, `blob20=error_kind`, and `double2=metric_value`.

## What to watch for

- `session_start` far exceeding `session_end + session_crash` for multiple days
- `session_crash = 0` for long periods despite known crashes
- large `lifecycle_ids_without_install` counts
- a single telemetry ID dominating session totals (dev/test skew)
- zeroed transport totals after transport-aware releases (missing migration)
- `daily_active_users` row counts diverging from raw distinct-user checks
- headline DAU including `build_channel != 'release'` or raw event counts instead of distinct users
- headline DAU/installs including CI traffic (`is_ci = 1`); prefer the `*_noci` columns. A spike in `ci_ids_30d` / `ci_install_ids` from `health.sql` means CI runners are inflating user and install counts.

## Accuracy notes

- DAU/WAU/MAU should be distinct `telemetry_id` counts, never event counts. Heavy users and long-running agents can emit thousands of `turn_end` events in a day.
- Use `meaningful_release_active` for headline product usage. It excludes local/dev/git-checkout traffic and open/close sessions with no meaningful lifecycle activity.
- For the cleanest headline numbers, prefer the `*_noci` columns, which additionally exclude `is_ci = 1` traffic. Ephemeral CI runners mint a fresh `telemetry_id` per job, so unfiltered they look like brand-new users and installs, inflating active-user/install counts and depressing retention. The client also skips the `install` event under CI, so historical CI installs (before that ships) are the main residual source; the rollup's `last_is_ci` flag lets dashboards filter the rest. Raw events stay tagged (not dropped) so CI crash/error signal is still queryable.
- Meaningful activity is derived from `session_end`/`session_crash` **and** `turn_end` events. A `turn_end` only fires after a real user turn completes, so counting it keeps the metric accurate for users whose `session_end` is lost (process killed, machine shutdown, dropped final flush, or a session still open at UTC midnight).
- **Retention pruning**: D1 hard-caps databases at 500 MB. When the cap is hit, every insert fails with HTTP 500 and telemetry silently stops being recorded (this happened in June 2026; ~3 days of events were lost). The worker now runs a nightly cron (`scheduled` handler, see `RETENTION_DAYS` in `src/worker.js`) that prunes high-volume raw rows: `turn_end`/`session_start`/`onboarding_step` after 30 days, `upgrade` after 60, `auth_success` after 180, `session_end`/`session_crash` after 365, `web_pageview`/`subscription_router_error` after 90, `web_cta_click`/`subscription_budget_exhausted` after 365, `subscription_login` after 180. `install`, `feedback`, `subscription_activated`, and `account_linked` rows are never pruned.  Because of this, **historical user/DAU queries must read `daily_active_users`, not raw `events`** - the rollup is backfilled across full history (migration 0014) and maintained at insert time.
- **D1 100-column cap**: production `events` has 98 columns after migration 0016 and D1 refuses `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` past 100 (`too many columns`). Migration 0005's per-turn/session-cadence columns never applied to production `events`; migration 0013 moved those fields into `turn_details`/`session_details`, and migration 0016 put the web beacon fields in `web_details` for the same reason. Do not add new columns to `events`; add them to the detail tables.
- Raw events remain the source of truth within their retention windows. The `daily_active_users` table is an ingest-time rollup for cheap dashboard queries and is the durable record beyond those windows.
- The worker uses `INSERT OR IGNORE` keyed by `event_id`; rollups and detail rows are updated only when the canonical raw event insert succeeds, so client retries do not inflate counts.
- Telemetry still undercounts users who opt out (`JCODE_NO_TELEMETRY`, `DO_NOT_TRACK`, `~/.jcode/no_telemetry`) or whose network blocks telemetry, and may overcount one person using multiple machines.
